experiences:
  - company: "Viant Technology"
    title: "Director, Cloud Reliability Engineering"
    location: "Irvine, CA (remote)"
    start_date: "2017-03-01"
    end_date: "2025-08-16"
    achievements:
      - "Introduced quality engineering discipline into Cloud Reliability Engineering organization, collaborating with Development and SRE teams to define unified quality strategy—embedding unit, integration, and end-to-end test automation with CI/CD quality gates to reduce production defects and increase deployment confidence"
      - "Delivered 99.9% platform uptime through disciplined SRE practices—implementing zero-downtime deployment patterns, infrastructure-as-code provisioning for all platform services, and robust pre-deployment testing in lower environments"
      - "Built Monitoring-as-Code framework using Playwright and Checkly to measure uptime and validate reliability after each release"
      - "Architected observability-driven quality metrics, exporting OpenTelemetry (OTel) data from build and release pipelines to Prometheus and Grafana dashboards, enabling real-time visibility into test coverage, failure trends, and release health"
      - "Scaled shift-left practices across 80+ microservices by integrating pre-commit hooks, static analysis, and automated validation frameworks directly into GitHub Actions workflows, standardizing quality enforcement and accelerating feedback"
      - "Led initiative to design and implement Locust-based load and scaling tests for Kubernetes (EKS, Karpenter, KEDA), proactively validating autoscaling reliability and preventing performance regressions as part of release certification"
      - "Standardized post-deployment contract and endpoint validation using Artillery.io and shared API-testing utilities, ensuring microservices behaved as expected and maintained compatibility across all environments"
      - "Implemented observability modernization by migrating to self-hosted Grafana OSS stack with Monitoring as Code, achieving $100K+ annual cost savings"
      - "Engineered and automated disaster-recovery validation processes using warm-standby EKS clusters and Aurora Global Database—successfully executed during AWS us-east-1 outage, minimizing downtime and preserving business continuity"
      - "Collaborated with Development to design custom canary deployment framework using ALB header-based routing to direct targeted user traffic, enabling controlled feature previews and low-risk, data-driven release decisions"
