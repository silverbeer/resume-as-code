experiences:
  - company: "Viant Technology"
    title: "Director, Cloud Reliability Engineering"
    location: "Irvine, CA (remote)"
    start_date: "2018-01-01"
    end_date: "2025-08-25"
    achievements:
      - "Built and led a high-performing distributed SRE team of seven engineers across office, remote, and internship programs. Oversaw full lifecycle people management—including hiring, onboarding, mentoring, performance reviews, and career growth—while establishing agile delivery practices (Kanban → sprints) and ensuring reliable on-call operations."
      - "Guided the SRE organization through multi-year operational excellence transformation, shepherding the team from ad-hoc operations to a disciplined Cloud Platform function by embedding real SDLC discipline—introducing structured planning, pre-commit hooks, automated testing, and static analysis—while partnering with development and quality engineering teams to improve collaboration, code quality, and delivery reliability."
      - "Achieved the organizational OKR of 99.9% platform uptime by architecting resilient systems and leading incident management and root cause analysis. Introduced an innovative GitOps-driven Monitoring-as-Code framework using Checkly and Playwright, enabling automated, measurable uptime validation and continuous reliability reporting."
      - "Embedded SRE engineers into development sprints to work alongside Product and Engineering, aligning Infrastructure-as-Code, CI/CD pipelines, and monitoring coverage with new feature delivery and roadmap priorities."
      - "Partnered with the Security Operations team during SOC 2 and ISO 27001 audits, resolving infrastructure-related security findings and supporting deployment of Wiz within EKS clusters to improve visibility and strengthen continuous cloud-security posture management."
      - "Active, modern Python developer (Typer, Pydantic, Rich, AWS SDK) who writes production-grade automation and internal tooling—building CLIs, event-driven services, and CI/CD integrations that remove toil and make engineers faster, bridging DevOps, observability, and developer productivity through code."
      - "Developed internal Python CLI tooling to streamline GitHub Enterprise migration—automating repository discovery (inactive repos, open PRs, security alerts), preparation tasks, and Postgres-backed tracking for multi-engineer collaboration."
      - "Built event-driven release-notes automation using AWS Lambda (Python, Pydantic) triggered by Jira webhooks, integrating Jira and GitHub APIs with DynamoDB persistence to improve traceability and eliminate manual documentation."
      - "Automated nightly RDS snapshot restores (Python + Boto3) to provision pre-production environments from Aurora snapshots, accelerating release validation within CI/CD pipelines."
      - "Implemented Airflow-based automation on EKS, containerizing recurring workloads and integrating Opsgenie alerts for job failures, centralizing visibility and improving reliability of batch processes."
      - "Led migration of eight workloads from EC2 (ALB/ASG) to Kubernetes (EKS), standardizing deployments with Helm charts and GitHub Actions → Argo CD pipelines for controlled environment promotion. Applied Cloud FinOps principles to optimize cluster efficiency with Karpenter and KEDA, reducing lower-environment costs while preserving production parity and deployment consistency."
      - "Modernized observability by replacing a SaaS platform with a self-hosted Grafana (Mimir, Loki, Tempo) stack on EKS, delivering $100K+ in annual cost savings through Cloud FinOps optimization while introducing Monitoring-as-Code to give development teams full ownership of dashboards, alerts, and service visibility."
      - "Implemented Cloud FinOps cost visibility by configuring AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR) and loading cost data into Google BigQuery for advanced analysis, enabling cross-functional teams to track spending trends, identify optimization opportunities, and drive data-driven cloud cost decisions using AWS Cost Explorer and custom dashboards."
      - "Oversaw deployment automation for 80+ Golang microservices on AWS, introducing reusable Terraform modules and GitHub Actions workflows to standardize delivery. Implemented post-deployment contract and endpoint tests to validate service reliability across all environments and ensure consistent release quality."
      - "Brought operational discipline to AI development by implementing a GitOps-based workflow for managing OpenAI assistants in Azure AI Foundry. Built Terraform IaC and GitHub Actions pipelines to enable controlled promotion of assistants from dev to production, enforcing environment separation, limiting direct developer access, and ensuring secure, auditable releases."
      - "Designed and operationalized a disaster recovery architecture using a warm-standby EKS cluster and Aurora Global Database, proven effective during the recent AWS us-east-1 outage to maintain uptime and protect critical Ad Tech workloads."
      - "Designed and led development of a custom canary-deployment framework with full production parity—replicating monitoring, CI/CD pipelines, and quality gates in isolated canary environments to enable precise testing, customer feature previews, and low-risk production rollouts via HTTP header-based ALB routing."
